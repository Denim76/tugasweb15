    <h1><mark style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)">Yoo Mina, since she awakened to her Qliphoth Factor, has become all the more powerful as a vanguard, now swinging her sword without restriction.
        Even after that fateful battle with the Replacers, she stayed in the TASKFORCE industry, and has grown into a veteran member of her team who's nothing like the clueless rookie she once was. She's also broken out of her shell which kept her from getting close to others at the company when she first join. Now, she's an exemplary leader who has all her team members on her side. She, however, hasn't changed as far as spending and finances go, working instead of taking vacation days and buying cheap package meals at convenience stores.
        
        She's embarrassed to talk about this side of her. Please try not to comment about her coin purse.

        Dragon Buster Regin and Fafnir are solely created to withstand the power of Hilde's Qliphoth Factor. Records say they hibernated for a long time before they were reactivated by a recent battle with the Replacers.
        
        Theoretically, they have endless potential because they have no output limits. But since they can only be activated by the specific Factor inside Hilde, they're useless to other Counters.</mark></h1>

He's always been an unreadable enigma to those around him. Even he himself didn't know what he wanted.
        He had scores to settle, but he was reluctant. He wanted to forgive his enemy, but he couldn't find a reason to. Then, he was forced to face his dilemma at the border between life and death, and his aimless wandering was over. He was freed from the old pain that had tormented him for a long time. He's found enlightenment. Now, he no longer hesitates to draw the sword that he received from his mother. Nor quietly excuses himself from the battle scene without others knowing. Instead, he now fights at the front lines, protecting his friends at the most critical moment.
        
        But of course, he claims that nothing about him was changed.

The Empire's subjects all believed that he was the one to save the world, and the boy also made it his duty to do so.

        After a long time, the empire eventually fell and no more subjects were left to save. However, the boy was unable to give up his journey to save the world because he could not let the expectations of those who hoped for salvation perish in vain. Eons have passed, and now this kind boy who was once hailed as the Savior finally came to realize. That the end of the journey to salvation is only for him to become an invader himself and destroy another world.</mark></h1>
